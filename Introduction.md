# Introduction to Analytics Modelling
> A critical key to success has been analytics modeling, selecting and specifying the right analytics model or models to combine into a solution, compiling, building, and/or forecasting the necessary data sets, and then interpreting the model's output to make suggestions that match the organization's needs, priorities, and structure.

- **Descriptive Questions?** (that ask for explanations of what happened)
  - How much effect did a new system
for scanning carry-on luggage have
on airport security wait times?
  - When did the reliability of a critical component of a piece of manufacturing equipment drop below an acceptable level?
  - Which sets of customers are most alike in their buying patterns?
  - What factors are most important
in determining customer similarity?
  - Is a new medical treatment
better than what's currently being used?


- **Predictive Questions?** (what's going to happen in the future)
  - How much worldwide demand will there be for crude oil next year, or five or ten years from now?
  - What will Google's stock price be a year from now, and how much uncertainty is there in that estimate?
  - How likely is it that a person with certain characteristics will eat in my restaurant chain if I send him a coupon or vote for the political candidate I support or click on a specific banner ad on a website?


- **Prescriptive Questions?** (what action or actions would be best)
  - How should traffic lights be timed and synchronized to minimize delays downtown when there's a major sporting event?
  - When and where should giant oil tankers make pickups and deliveries all around the world?
  - What strategies can an airline use
    to get passengers to their destinations quickly before, during, and after a big snow storm?


- **More general questions?**
  - Like we just installed technology to track all kinds of detailed information that we never had before
    so how do we monetize it?
  - How can we use that data to create value for our company?


## Modelling:
> In analytics, ***modeling means taking a real life situation and expressing the key parts of that situation
in terms of math.*** So we can analyze the math and then turn the mathematical analysis back into a real life answer or solution or recommendation.
